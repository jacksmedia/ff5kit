Weapon Tweaks v3 (2024)
----------------------

Data mods to items (weapons)

Adds Spellblade (grapical effect) support to Axes/Spears/Katanas/Rune

Adds Double Grip (Optional) to Spears

Changes Harps to not be so useless

Drain Blade Hit% buff so it's somewhat usable without being a Freelancer/Mime
