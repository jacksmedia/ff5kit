HatZen08's FFV Strategic Battle (2014)
-------------------------------------
Changes: Job Abilities & Ability functions
3-slots for all Jobs

Introduction
------------
The hack changes the job system. All jobs, without exception, only have the fight and the
item command as default. All other commands must be learned by gained ABP before they can be
used. It raises the difficulty of the game because many commands, given by free as a default
command for a job, aren't available until they are learned.

For better customization, all jobs have three slots available for extra abilities, similar to the
mimic job in the original game. To balance this feature, with few exceptions, jobs don't have innate
abilities in this version of the hack.

The list of abilities by job was also redesigned for the new system. They were updated with
relatively lower ABP costs and better distribution of abilities by job. Also, a few commands were
updated or redesigned.

The hack is intended as a moderated challenge for players.

Notes
-----
English translation
The patch is aimed for the Japanese rom of Final Fantasy V with the RPGe translation for
the English language.

Permanent abilities
-------------------
The following abilities are permanently set: Passages, Damage Floor and Dash. Because of
a bug, in the start of the game, the default character doesn't gain the mentioned abilities until they
are updated. They will be updated when the player selects the equip menu or change a job.

Erased abilities
----------------
The following abilities were erased from the game and they can't be learned: hp up 10%, hp
up 20%, mp up 10%, Swdsplap and escape.

Updated abilities
-----------------
The following abilities were updated or redesigned:
- Analyze: Casts Wall and Haste. The Wall effect wears off after a while, but the command
can be used continually to recast the Wall effect.
- Dragon: Drains MP. Unlike the original game, it doesn't drains HP.
- Flirt: Casts Charm on the target. Unlike the original game, it works now if the enemy isn't
protected against Charm.
- Kick: It inflicts exactly 150HP on all enemies. In normal conditions, it can't be dodged.
- Mantra: In battle, raises the user level by one. It can be cast multiple times to raise damage
inflicted on enemies.
- Observe: Casts Armor and Shell. Good for jobs with low defense.
- Revive: Revives all dead characters with 25% of max hp.
- Slash: Inflicts damage based on max HP minus actual HP.
- X-Fight: Inflicts from 1 to 4 hits with equipped weapon. Unlike the original game, the
weapon damage isn't fixed and can be influenced like a normal weapon. It includes front and
back rows, critical hits, few special effects, etc.
